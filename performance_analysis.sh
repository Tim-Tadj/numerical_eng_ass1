# You should write a bash script called performance analysis.sh that automatically runs
# the various analyses, collates the results for each parallelisation strategy, prints a numerical
# report in the terminal, and generates plots using the gnuplot program. It should save the
# gnuplot plots into PNG formatted image files for inclusion into your Powerpoint slides.
# You are to use /usr/bin/time to do the timing and memory measurements. Also feel
# free to use any combination of bash, sed and awk to facilitate the analyses (e.g. using bash
# for loops to cycle through parameters to pass to your program, sed and awk to extract
# the relevant numbers, etc.).
